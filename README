Nanopb is a small code-size Protocol Buffers implementation.

Homepage: http://kapsi.fi/~jpa/nanopb/

To compile the library, you'll need these libraries:
protobuf-compiler python-protobuf libprotobuf-dev

To run the tests, run make under the tests folder.
If it completes without error, everything is fine. 

Code size optimization is currently only supported for 32-bit 
architecture. If you want to run on 64-bit architecture,
you must disable code size optimization by providing -n option to
code generator nanopb_generator.py.  

For testing purpose, you may need to pass -m32 compiler to gcc if 
you're running on a 64-bit machine unless -n option is used for code 
generation.
